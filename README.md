## 👤 About Me
Hi! I am a passionate third-year Diploma in ICT – Software Engineering student with a strong love for building and designing software-based projects. I enjoy working on coding challenges that push my creativity and sharpen my development skills.

Currently, I’m completing a 1-year internship at Plum Systems as a Full Stack Software Engineer, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development. This role is helping me apply my academic knowledge to real-world applications while working in a collaborative engineering team.

I love being in spaces surrounded by other software engineers — especially at hackathons, where I compete, volunteer, and connect with professionals in the tech industry. These events fuel my passion for technology and keep me informed about the latest tools and trends. I am driven by continuous learning, innovation, and the excitement of building solutions that make a difference.
